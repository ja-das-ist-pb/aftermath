**aftermath**

"aftermath" is a mathematical Python model, made by 
Zhong-Zheng senior high school students

why do I suggest u to use the this model instead of 
using "math" model in python?

In the model we provide more acurate constants, such 
as pi and Euler number. Futhermoere, this model provide 
some basic matrix operations, like addition, determinant, 
etc..

motivation

I was a student who tortured by Taiwanese high school math.
This makes me to made a model in Python to simplify the 
operations. 
People can treat this model as a convenient calculator.
